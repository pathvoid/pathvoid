# Martin-Patrick Larouche  
### Building quiet tools in noisy systems  
**Privacy isn’t a feature. It’s a foundation.**

I design and build reliable, privacy-first systems with a strong focus on clarity, automation, and long-term maintainability.  
My work sits at the intersection of **software engineering**, **data integrity**, and **AI-assisted automation**, with a strong emphasis on user trust and platform safety.

I believe good systems should be:
- Transparent by design  
- Predictable in behavior  
- Respectful of user data  
- Quietly effective rather than attention-seeking

## Flagship Project — NoBullFit

**NoBullFit** is a privacy-first health and fitness tracking platform that I actively design, build, and operate.

It allows users to track nutrition, recipes, activities, weight, and wellness data while maintaining **full ownership of their information**.  
Core features remain free, and data is never sold or exploited.

- Live platform: https://nobull.fit  
- Web application repository:  
  https://github.com/pathvoid/nobullfit  

**Key characteristics**
- Modern web architecture (React, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL)
- Server-side rendering for performance and reliability
- Full data export and deletion capabilities
- Clear separation between product logic and background processing
- Strong privacy and data minimization principles

## AI & Automation — NoBullFit Worker

To support platform quality and safety, NoBullFit includes a dedicated **AI background worker** responsible for automated verification and moderation.

- Worker repository:  
  https://github.com/pathvoid/nobullfit-worker  

**What it handles**
- AI-based content verification
- Text and image moderation
- Illegal content detection and automatic containment
- Controlled scheduling to avoid over-processing
- Human escalation only when necessary

**Design goals**
- Safety without surveillance
- Automation without overreach
- Clear auditability of decisions
- Independent operation from the main web application

## Core Principles

**Privacy-first, always**  
User data belongs to the user. Privacy is treated as infrastructure, not a premium feature.

**Automation with accountability**  
AI is used to reduce manual workload, not to obscure decisions.

**Systems over shortcuts**  
I prioritize architectures that scale in clarity before they scale in size.

**Professional seriousness**  
I build tools meant to be maintained, audited, and trusted over time.

## Technical Focus

- Backend & APIs (TypeScript, Python, PostgreSQL)
- Background workers & automation pipelines
- AI integration (content analysis, moderation, verification)
- Data integrity & lifecycle management
- Platform safety and trust mechanisms
- Clean system boundaries and responsibility separation

---

## Current Direction

- Expanding AI-assisted verification capabilities
- Strengthening platform observability and safety tooling
- Building sustainable, self-hostable, privacy-respecting systems
- Applying these principles across health, productivity, and internal tooling
