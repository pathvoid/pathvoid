# Pathvoid — Privacy-First Development

I create privacy-first applications and tools — either by finding trustworthy alternatives or building my own when none exist.  
My projects range from fitness tracking platforms to media centers and personal infrastructure tools, all designed with user privacy and data ownership in mind.

## My Philosophy

Technology should work *for* people, not against them.  
That means:
- **Privacy-first** — No unnecessary data collection or tracking
- **Self-hosted options** — Giving users control over their data
- **Sustainable development** — Using open-source technologies
- **Cross-platform** — Making tools accessible everywhere
